# My Github Website

This is a testing ground for my html, css, and js/ts related shananigans.

## index.html & the-brothers.html & donate.js

Goofy website with cat pictures written by somebody who probably worships machines.

## terminal.html

A sudo-terminal-emulator that I made with heavy influence from [Kim Lim's terminal](https://kimlimjustin.github.io/old/). It is only a template for now, but I may use it to create a game in the future.
